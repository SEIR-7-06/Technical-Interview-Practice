# Technical Interview Practice

## The Goal of the Technical Interview
The technical interview is the portion of the interview process where your problem solving skills are put to the test!

You will be presented a challenge, and given time to explain your thought process as you build a solution.

However, the coding is the least important part of the technical interview. The key to acing an interview is ***communication***. 

To that end, here's what skills we'll be emphasizing and just as importantly, **not** emphasizing.

### What's not important:
* Whether you can successfully solve the problem.
* Whether you have the most optimal solution.
* Whether your syntax is correct.

### What is important:
* Talking through your thought process and keeping your interviewer in the loop.
* Being able to humbly ask for guidance when needed.
* Planning, diagraming, and psuedocoding before starting on the code.
* Fully understand the problem before starting by asking followup questions if needed.
* Ask about, and plan for edge cases.


Let's build a safe, and collaborative learning environment as we get our practice reps in during class!


## Basic Structure of the Activity
You're split into two groups, A and B.
A has been given one problem, B another.

Each member of Group A will be paired with a member from Group B, and each of you will take turns being the interviewer and the interviewee.


## Setup
What tools will be available?

### Do Use: 
- Your code editor
- Your interviewer as a resource to ask questions!

### Avoid:
- Googling the problem - You won't have the luxury of Google in an interview setting!
- Running your code - Once upon a time in pre-pandemic days you would write out your solution by hand with marker on a whiteboard, hence the term "Whiteboarding"! 



## Tips & Advice

### Interviewees:
- Talk through the problem - it's about the process, not the solution!
- Don't give up. Ask questions! 
- Solve the problem, don't build the app.
  - Don't sweat syntax.
  - Pseudocode.
  - Invent helper functions that don't yet exist.


### Interviewers:
- Encourage them to follow the advice above!
- Be positive and encouraging! There is absolutely no need to add additional stress, that already comes included.
- Don't solve the problem for them, but DO get them unstuck.
- Give them hints via, "What if you did this?"
